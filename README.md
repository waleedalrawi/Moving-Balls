# Moving-Balls

This is a rather elementary implementation of simulated balls moving on the screen made for the purpose of learning.

## Usage

Load the index.html page and enjoy :)
Balls change direction when hitting a border as well as get a random new size, color, and speed!

## Roadmap / questions

Some css had to be added inline in order for those attributes to be accessed by JS. Need to figure out how to access those attributes even when they are placed in the separate css style sheet. (Specifically referring to the first access to width and height attributes of ball.style, before those values are overwritten in JS. After they've been overwritten once in JS there are no issues).
